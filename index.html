        <h1>Metallica - Whiskey in the Jar</h1>
        
        <p> 
          As I was going over<br>
          The Cork and Kerry Mountains<br>
          I saw Captain Farrell<br>
          And his money he was countin'<br>
          I first produced my pistol<br>
          And then produced my rapier<br>
          I said "Stand and deliver<br>
          Or the devil he may take ya"<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I took all of his money<br>
        And it was a pretty penny<br>
        I took all of his money<br>
        Yeah and I brought it home to Molly<br>
        She swore that she loved me<br>
        No never would she leave me<br>
        But the devil take that woman<br>
        Yeah, for you know she tricked me easy<br>
        </p>

        </p>
        
        <p>
        Being drunk and weary<br>
        I went to Molly's chamber<br>
        Takin' my money with me<br>
        And I never knew the danger<br>
        For about six or maybe seven<br>
        In walked Captain Farrell<br>
        I jumped up, fired my pistols<br>
        And I shot him with both barrels<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Musha rain dum a doo dum a da, ha, ya<br>

        Oh-oh, ya<br>
        </p>

        Now some men like a fishin'<br>
        But some men like the fowlin'<br>
        Some men like to hear<br>
        To hear the cannonball a-roarin'<br>
        But me, I like sleepin'<br>
        `Specially in my Molly's chamber<br>
        But here I am in prison<br>
        Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah<br>
